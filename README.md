# mqtt-blinds

Control somfy blinds with home assistant by hacking the remote with a raspberry pi zero and a bunch of relays. 
Doing this today I would probably opt for a ESP32 and transistors instead.

Reads currently selected blind on the remote with the leds.
Presses select, up, down, stop with the relays.

Change names and add corresponding home assistant configuration as necessary.

Set environment variables, use systemd
